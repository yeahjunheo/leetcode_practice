# Valid Anagram

## Prompt

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
> Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"\
> Output: true

Example 2:
> Input: s = "rat", t = "car"\
> Output: false

## Brainstorm

We can make use of the solution from [contains duplicates](/golang/217.containsDuplicates.md) to make this happen.

We'll make use of the map to count how many of each letter we get, then we count down for each letter that appears in the next.

If the count ever reaches -1 and or is left with 1, we can return false, else true.

To ensure we make sure all answers are solved, we can have a check for -1 or 0 to return false AND a check for any left overs.

Another check would be to compare the lengths of `s` and `t`, since it is not guaranteed that they are equal.

Otherwise, return true.

## Solution
```go
func isAnagram(s string, t string) bool {
    if len(s) != len(t) { // intial check to make sure we have the same amount of characters
        return false
    }

    sMap := make(map[rune]int) // count for each letter
    for _, v := range s {
        sMap[v] += 1
    }

    for _, v := range t {
        if sMap[v] == 0 {
            return false
        }
        sMap[v] -= 1
    }
    
    return true
}
```
