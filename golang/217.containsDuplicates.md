# containsduplicates

## Prompt

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]\
> Output: true

Example 2:
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]\
> Output: false

Example 3:
> Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]\
> Output: true

## Brainstorm

The question asks to return true or false if there are any duplicates. The simple way of approaching this would be to go over each value in `nums` and check if there are any other element with the same value. 

In Python, we can make use of sets to compare the length of `nums` and the set and compare to check if its equal or not. However, I'm not sure if that can be done in golang. So I'll go over the method that comes to mind first.

```pseudo
iterate over each element in nums
    check if another element exists of the same value
        return true
return false

some function to compare with target value and rest of array
```

This method seems to cause a timeout, which makes sense especially if the array we're trying to work with is extremely long.

I found another way of imitating the sets using maps. I'll try that out next.


## Solution
```go
func containsDuplicate(nums []int) bool {
    numsMap := make(map[int]int)

    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        if numsMap[nums[i]] == 1{
            return true
        }
        numsMap[nums[i]] += 1
    }

    return false
}
```
